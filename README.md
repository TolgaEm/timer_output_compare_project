#  timer_output_compare_project
## STM32F103- ARM M3 Cortex Project 

**we used STM32F103RB NUCLEO board and STMCUBE ide**

**in this sample we used timer peripheral for output compare by any software coding in while loop**

**main idea in this sample that complately use hardware ability in nucleo card**
